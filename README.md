Evolution Simulator simulates evolution over many generations. Each creature has 2 alleles, each with values chaing their speed and vision.
Over time, creatues with alleles better fit for survival will asexually reproduce with a chance of mutation

This evolution may take place quickly or more slowly depending on environmental conditions such as the amount of food available.

There is a button to turn the histograms on for average speed and vision along with sliders for increasing game speed and amount of food that spawns.
